# classification-challenge
## Overview

-This project has a notebook called spam_detector.ipynb. The source code for this notebook is located in the -M13_Starter_Code folder. It shows how to build a program that can tell if a text message is spam or not spam (called -"ham"). It uses machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to make these predictions.

## Features

- Prepares text messages by cleaning them up (like removing unnecessary words and breaking them into parts).
- Turns text into numbers using methods like Bag of Words (BoW) or Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).
- Uses machine learning models like Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify messages.
- Checks how well the program works with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Can make predictions on new text messages.

## Results

The notebook will show:
- Examples of the cleaned-up dataset.
- Scores that tell how good the model is (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
- A confusion matrix to see where the model makes mistakes.
- Predictions on test messages.
